# Konrad
Konrad is a chatbot designed to uplift a person's spirits.

- It works by using a conversational model, DiabloGPT, from transformers to respond to the users' inputs. 
- It also utilizes a sentiment analysis model to determine the users' mood and respond accordingly.

## Created with
Python, Tkinker, Transformer models (DiabloGPT and DistilBERT)

## How to use
Run the app.py file using an IDE of your choice or from the terminal.

## Notes
The pipe1.py, pipe2.py, etc. are previous versions of the chatbot. They don't work with the app. They work inside the terminal instead.
